    <h1>Swift Guesser</h1>

    <p>
        Swift Guesser is a game I made where you have to guess the Taylor Swift song as 'swiftly' as possible. 
        This was my first big web project with Javascript, and it was a really big one.
        <br><br>
        I made Swift Guesser to have maximum modularity, so anybody can add more songs, albums, or artists by adding some mp3 files and editing the preexisting JSON files. 
        This is all <span><a href="https://github.com/Kolin63/swiftguesser/blob/master/Docs.md" target="_blank">documented on the GitHub</a></span>.
        <br><br>
        You can enable or disable specific albums in the config to play with whatever music you like, or you can turn them all on for a challenge!
        <br><br>
        Swiftguesser also has a fully fledged out global leaderboard, which lets you enter a three-character name to represent yourself. 
        Each song has a different leaderboard for each parameter, which means a lot of space to leave your name!
