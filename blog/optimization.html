    <h1>Optimization</h1>

    <p>
    One of the main reasons I started to learn C++ is that it is highly
    optimized. However, I think that some people don't understand the 
    importance of optimizing your code (note to name names, but the people
    that code Python). 
    <br><br>
    And I don't blame the Python developers. When you are at that high of a 
    level, it is easy to forget what is actually happening down in the metal. 
    But forgetting that makes your code very slow. 
    <br><br>
    But you might say something like, "Computers are so fast now! They don't
    need to be running optimized programs like they needed to in the 90's
    when our parents rode dinosaurs to school!" And I totally agree that 
    computers have gotten faster. In fact, they got so fast that the amount
    of computations done led to global warming and the dinosaurs went extinct. 
    <br><br>
    Yet, as computers got faster, the ambitions of the programs got higher. 
    Unreal 5 is a whole lot more realisitic than the original Unreal because
    the increase in computer performance allowed people to make more powerful
    programs. But computers are still not powerful enough to run games made in
    Unreal 5 at a high performance rate.
    <br><br>
    Keep in mind, Unreal 5 was made with C++, and some really good gaming 
    computers struggle to run it. Imagine if Unreal was made with Python. 
    <br><br>
    Do I need to say more?
