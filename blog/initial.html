    <h1>Initial Blog</h1>

    <p>
      I've decided that I want to blog a little bit.
      <BR><BR>
      Sometimes I think of things that I want to talk to somebody about,
      but nobody would be interested in it. And even if somebody is, I'm sure
      that I would forget before I got the chance to get it out of my mouth.
      <BR><BR>
      I think that I will write about everything here, not just development
      updates or even coding specific things. Also, FortiNet categorized
      my website as 'Useless Information' rather than 'Personal Blogging'
      (or some sort of category along those lines), which is a little
      offensive.
