    <h1>My Thoughts on Github</h1>

    <p>
      You would think that GitHub would kind of suck (at least a little bit)
      because it is owned by Microsoft, a big company. But to my delight, it
      has been everything I wanted, and more. 
      <BR><BR>
      I recently started to primarily use the command line for everything I 
      do, which includes doing my Git commits. When I used Windows in my
      pre-enlightenment times, I would use GitHub's Graphical Desktop 
      Application. It was actually really good, except that some things were
      hard to do and I would end up going into the command line anyways to 
      paste a command from Stack Overflow.
      <BR><BR>
      On Linux, I can use the default git command by Torvalds to do my commits 
      and branch switches and whatnot. But if I want to make a pull request
      or an issue, I would have to go to the web. That is, until I realized
      how awesome GitHub's CLI tool is.
      <BR><BR>
      Like I said, you would expect GitHub to not even have a CLI, because it 
      is a Microsoft-owned company that has a nice website. But, the `gh`
      command can almost entirely replace the website, which makes my workflow
      BLAZINGLY FAST!!!
      <BR><BR>
      My favorite part is that all of the commands are entirely intuitive,
      with no weird names that are hard to remember. For example, `gh pr 
      create` would make a pull request. And you don't even need to memorize
      parameters like --name or whatever, because it provides you with a nice 
      TUI (I don't know if it would classify as a TUI, more like a series of 
      prompts that let you type in the name and description). 
      <BR><BR>
      So if you haven't started using the gh command, I would highly 
      recommend it. You probably have it installed already for authentication
      with the GitHub servers when you are pushing commits to origin. Thanks
      for reading!
