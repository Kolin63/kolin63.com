    <h1>C(PP)risis</h1>

    <p>
    I have spent at least a year learning CPP, and I really like it. 
    But I'm having a bit of an existential crisis over whether I should use
    CPP or plain C.
    <BR><BR>
    I don't know how it started, but I think a big part of it is that CPP 
    can look a little messy. All of the templates and namespace operators 
    end up cluttering my code and making it a little hard to read. 
    <BR><BR>
    But I love OOP and classes, so I don't know if coding in C would be a 
    good idea for me. I don't want to have to write different structs for 
    every type I use it for when I could just use templates in CPP. And for
    the record, I think that operator overloading is great when used correctly.
    To that, many would say "But you *can* use it incorrectly, so it's bad!"
    And to that I say, "Just don't use it incorrectly!"
    <BR><BR>
    Also, the entire point of CPP was to provide a safe alternative to C. 
    C isn't a super safe language, with all of the memory issues. So I don't 
    know if writing in C would just bring more problems. 
    <BR><BR>
    I wasn't planning on getting anywhere with writing this. If anything, I 
    was hoping that I would come to a conclusion of what I wanted to do if I 
    wrote it all out in words. But I still don't know, so I guess I'll have to 
    think about it more.
