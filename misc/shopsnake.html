  <h1>Shop Snake</h1>

  <p>
    This is a very simple snake game I made where half of the time the apples
    are coins. Once you get three coins, you can spend them to reduce your snake
    length.
    <br>
    It's super simple because this is the first time I am using the game engine
    Raylib. I hope you like it!
