  <p>
    Hello there! LPW is a wrapper around lp, which is a Unix command to send
    files to a printer (as in a printer that prints paper).
  </p>
  <h2>&#x1F427; Linux</h2>
  <p>
    LPW was developed for Linux, so you can just run the installation script
    on the Github page and start using it!
  </p>
  <h2>&#x1F34E; Mac</h2>
  <p>
    If you are on Mac, you may need to run LPW with -CI depending on what
    terminal emulator you use. Also the installation script won't work, so you
    will need to manually download the lpw file and execute it.
  </p>
  <h2>&#x1FA9F; Windows</h2>
  <p>
    If you are on Windows, sorry but you can't use it! However, there is a GIF
    on the Github that should sufficiently demonstrate what LPW can do.
